How did I create this web portfolio?

1, I designed this web portfolio mockup in the User Experience Design course, and my inspiration was based on the website created by https://brittanychiang.com/.

2, I utilized VS code to start the coding part of this Web Portfolio.

3, The benifit of this coding experience is I learned a lot of skills of how to use bootstrap. Bootstrap makes layour become easier, reduce a lot of codes in style.css file. But I'm not sure if it is benifit for the begining study process.

4, The biggest challenge:
when I was coding the experience section of the home page. I was expecting to design a interactive section just like the "Where I've Worked" section of my inspiration website (https://brittanychiang.com/). in order to reduce the space as well as increase the interaction with users.
But I couldn't create a same animation as the inspiration website. I spend 2 days try to figure it out, but I failed, and I guess maybe those interaction need JavaScript to implement. I'v never touched any Javascript. So I tried to use ( Bootstrap - collapse components - .accordion attribute ) to implement this part, finally, the effect looked not bad, but I still don't know how to let the active status the same color with hovering status in this situation.

The assets almost were designed by myself using illustrator and XD.
The lists of below assets do not belong to my own design.
